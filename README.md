## 🧪 Clinical Projects

### 🔹 **📁 CDISC SDTM + ADaM Creation (SAS)**  
🧾 Raw clinical datasets → SDTM domains → ADaM datasets  
- Created SDTM datasets: [`DM`](https://github.com/Aishwaryac4297/SAS-SDTM-DM-Project),[`EX`](https://github.com/Aishwaryac4297/SAS-SDTM-EX-Project)from raw data using CDISC SDTMIG.
- [Derived ADaM dataset](https://github.com/Aishwaryac4297/SAS-ADaM-ADSL-Project)

### 🔹 **📁 TLF Generation & Reporting (SAS)**  
📊 [Clinical Summary Table Generation](https://github.com/Aishwaryac4297/SAS-TLF-Generation-Project)  
- Produced summary tables.  
- Automated using **SAS Macros** and styled with `ODS RTF/PDF` for regulatory-ready output.  
- Used `PROC REPORT`, `PROC MEANS`, `PROC FREQ`, and `PROC TRANSPOSE`.
  
📊 [Clinical Report Listing Generation](https://github.com/Aishwaryac4297/SAS-Clinical-Report-Listing-Project)
- Developed a regulatory-compliant clinical report listing using ADSL and ADVS datasets.
- Merged datasets via PROC SQL, formatted gender values, and generated subject-level vitals report using PROC REPORT.
- Created listings as per CDISC and clinical trial reporting standards for submission purposes.
- Tools used: SAS 9.4 (Base SAS, SQL, REPORT procedure).

### 🔹 **📁 R-Programming**  
📈 R Programming based projects  
- [Demographic Summary Table: Generated treatment-based summary statistics.](https://github.com/Aishwaryac4297/R-Project-Demographic-Summary-Table-Creation)
- [Clinical Report RTF: Automated formatted RTF clinical summaries.](https://github.com/Aishwaryac4297/R-project-Clinical-RTF-Table-Generation)
